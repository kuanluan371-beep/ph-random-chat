# AFTER creating your GitHub repository, run these commands:

# 1. Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ph-random-chat.git

# 2. Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# 3. Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# If you get authentication error, GitHub will prompt you to login
# Or you can use GitHub Desktop for easier authentication


# === ALTERNATIVE: Use GitHub Desktop (Easier) ===
# 1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
# 2. Install and sign in
# 3. File → Add Local Repository
# 4. Select: C:\Users\Marky\Downloads\RANDOMCHAT
# 5. Click "Publish repository" button
# Done!
